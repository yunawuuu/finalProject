# Final Project
This repository will be where you complete your final project for the class Big Data and Economics. 

# README (insert a title here)
*Use this space to create a README for the project so that I (or someone else) could happen upon this repository and understand:
1. What is the project about?
2. How is the project structured?
3. How do I replicate the project? 

# Scoresheet
This project will have several iterative deadlines below:

## Project Proposal
This should be one page at most. The key thing is to identify a research question you want to ask and potential data sources you have in mind. If you have a key method to apply in mind or a paper you want to build off of -- even better! 

## Literature Review
This should walk through critical literature related to your topic. These should be scholarly sources or data science sources (depending on the research question). 

## Data Description
This should clearly describe the data:
- Where did it come from?
- How could I access it?
- Summary of key features of the data

## Methods
Tell me what empirical method you are using, how it addresses the question, and what potential flaws with this method are. For example, if you use difference-in-difference design, tell me about the parallel trends assumption and what it means in your setting. 

## Findings
Briefly describe the results in your paper. Say the key finding and show it visually (if you can make a graph) or with a well-formatted table. 

## Conclusion
Tell me what you told me and potential directions for future research. 

## Written Report
Put all of the above together.

## Code
I am evaluating on how the code works.
