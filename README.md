# Final Project
This repository will be where you complete your final project for the class Big Data and Economics. 

## Steps to get started:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Make sure this repository is private by navigating to `Settings` and changing it to Private under the **Danger Zone**
3. Add me (kgcsport) as a collaborator by going to `Settings` > `Collaborators and teams`. 
4. Clone your repository to your personal computer, so you can get to work on it over time.
5. Create folders for `code`, `data`, `writing`, `literature`, or any others that feel relevant. Turn in the project proposal, literature review, data analysis, and final written project, as well as their associated `*tex.` or `.Rmd` code in the `writing` folder. 
6. Add files to your `.gitignore` like `*.csv`, `*.dta`, `*.tsv` that I have not added. 
7. Start developing your project.

# README (insert a title here)
*Use this space to create a README for the project so that I (or someone else) could happen upon this repository and understand:
1. What is the project about?
2. How is the project structured?
3. How do I replicate the project?

## Project Proposal
This should be one page at most. The key thing is to identify a research question you want to ask and potential data sources you have in mind. If you have a key method to apply in mind or a paper you want to build off of -- even better! 

## Literature Review
This should walk through critical literature related to your topic. These should be scholarly sources or data science sources (depending on the research question). 

## Data Description
This should clearly describe the data:
- Where did it come from?
- How could I access it?
- Summary of key features of the data

You can find some "big" datasets at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or a guide by [Christine Murray]( https://libguides.bates.edu/ECON368).

## Methods
Tell me what empirical method you are using, how it addresses the question, and what potential flaws with this method are. For example, if you use difference-in-difference design, tell me about the parallel trends assumption and what it means in your setting. 

## Findings
Briefly describe the results in your paper. Say the key finding and show it visually (if you can make a graph) or with a well-formatted table. 

## Conclusion
Tell me what you told me and potential directions for future research. 

## Written Report
Put all of the above together.

## Code
I am evaluating on how the code works. I should be able to run it on my computer.
